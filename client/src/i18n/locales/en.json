        "q": "How long does it take to generate profile photos?",
        "a": "Photos are ready in 1 to 2 minutes. Previously you need to train the model with your selfies."
      },
      {
        "q": "What type of photos should I upload to create AI profile photos?",
        "a": "We recommend uploading photos with high variety, a mix of close-up selfies and full-body photos in different places, angles, clothes and expressions. Don't upload photos with low variety, group photos, other people, sunglasses, hats, photos where your face is cut off or not visible."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much will the photos look like me?",
        "a": "The similarity of the photos to you depends on the quality and variety of the photos you upload. The better and more varied your photos are, the more accurate the AI can be in understanding and representing your unique features. We continue to improve our models every day."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my information secure? Do my photos and models remain private?",

      },
      {
        "q": "Who can use my AI profile photos?",
        "a": "No one. Your photos will be yours only. After 30 days they will be deleted from our servers."

      {
        "q": "Can I get a refund?",

        "a": "No, credits do not expire. However, the AI model you trained expires after 30 days. You must use your credits within that time."
      },
      {
        "q": "What style of photos will I receive?",
        "a": "Once your AI model is trained, you can select different styles from the Create tab. Each time you generate a photo in a selected style, you'll receive 4 different variants in that style. This allows you to experiment with various looks and choose your favorites."
      },
      {
        "q": "How long does it take to generate photos?",
        "a": "The process happens in two steps: First, we train your AI model, which takes 15-30 minutes. After that, you can generate photos at any time, and each generation takes only 1-2 minutes to create 4 variants."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "a": "Yes, we offer a 100% refund guarantee if you are not satisfied with the quality of your photos. You can request a full refund within the first 7 days after your purchase."
      },
      {
        "q": "What payment methods do you accept?",
        "a": "We process all transactions using Stripe. You can pay using credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay and more."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I ensure the quality of my photos?",
        "a": "Before training a model, we recommend reading our guide. This way you'll ensure that the generated photos are of the best possible quality."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who can use my photos and what about privacy?",
        "a": "Your photos are exclusively yours. We prioritize your privacy and automatically delete all generated photos from our database after 30 days. The photos you generate are for your personal use and will not be shared or accessible to anyone else."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if the generated photos don't look like me?",
        "a": "If you follow our instructions for selecting training images, you should get around 80% usable photos that look like you. We continuously update our models to improve accuracy. If you have doubts before starting, don't hesitate to contact us for guidance."
      },
      {
        "q": "Will the AI learn my unique characteristics?",
        "a": "Yes, our AI is excellent at understanding and replicating what makes you unique. You can also adjust specific characteristics when generating images, such as whether you wear glasses or other distinctive features."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where can I use these photos?",
        "a": "The photos are versatile and can be used anywhere you need a professional image of yourself. They're perfect for professional profile photos (LinkedIn, company websites), social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) or personal branding. You can choose different dimensions like square format for profile photos or portrait mode for Instagram stories and other vertical designs."

        "q": "Will the AI learn my unique characteristics?",
