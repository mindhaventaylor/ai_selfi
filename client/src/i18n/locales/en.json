        "q": "How long does it take to generate profile photos?",
        "a": "Photos are ready in 1 to 2 minutes. Previously you need to train the model with your selfies."

      {
        "q": "What type of photos should I upload to create AI profile photos?",
        "a": "We recommend uploading photos with high variety, a mix of close-up selfies and full-body photos in different places, angles, clothes and expressions. Don't upload photos with low variety, group photos, other people, sunglasses, hats, photos where your face is cut off or not visible."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much will the photos look like me?",
        "a": "The similarity of the photos to you depends on the quality and variety of the photos you upload. The better and more varied your photos are, the more accurate the AI can be in understanding and representing your unique features. We continue to improve our models every day."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my information secure? Do my photos and models remain private?",
        "a": "Yes! The models you create and the photos you upload and take remain private. Your personal data, images and AI models are stored securely, and our system is designed to protect your information from unauthorized access."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who can use my AI profile photos?",
        "a": "No one. Your photos will be yours only. After 30 days they will be deleted from our servers."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I get a refund?",
        "a": "Yes, we offer a full refund guarantee if you are not satisfied with the results."
